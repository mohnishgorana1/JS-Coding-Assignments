// You are building a word count generator that will take a large string of text as input and output the words and
// the number of times they are present in the string. Your task is to write a function that can count the
// occurrences of each word in the string and return a Map containing each word's count. For simplicity, you can
// assume that the string only contains alphabetic characters and spaces.
